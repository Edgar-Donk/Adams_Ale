# Water Properties

Shows the  [thermophysical properties of water](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239243539_Simple_Formulas_for_Thermophysical_Properties_of_Liquid_Water_for_Heat_Transfer_Calculations_from_0C_to_150C) 
in a simplified 
form based on the equations that are internationally acknowledged as
correct at the time of publication 1998.
