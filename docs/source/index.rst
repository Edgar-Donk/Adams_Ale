.. topic:: Purpose

   Shows the `thermophysical properties of water <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239243539_Simple_Formulas_for_Thermophysical_Properties_of_Liquid_Water_for_Heat_Transfer_Calculations_from_0C_to_150C>`_ 
   in a simplified 
   form based on the equations that are internationally acknowledged as
   correct at the time of publication 1998. 
   
.. hint:: The charts are interactive so run the mouse over the plot, where the
